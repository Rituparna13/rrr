            <h2>Learn Javascript - in fun way!</h2>
            <p>
              Before you start learning something new, it’s important to
              understand exactly what it is and what it does. This is especially
              useful when it comes to mastering a new programming language. In
              simple terms, JavaScript is a programming language used to make
              websites interactive. If you think about the basic makeup of a
              website, you have HTML, which describes and defines the basic
              content and structure of the website, then you have CSS, which
              tells the browser how this HTML content should be
              displayed—determining things like color and font. With just HTML
              and CSS, you have a website that looks good but doesn’t actually
              do much. JavaScript brings the website to life by adding
              functionality. It’s is responsible for elements that the user can
              interact with, such as drop-down menus, modal windows, and contact
              forms. It is also used to create things like animations, video
              players, and interactive maps. Nowadays, JavaScript is an
              all-purpose programming language—meaning it runs across the entire
              software stack. The most popular application of it is on the
              client side (aka frontend), but since Node.js came on the scene,
              many people run JavaScript on the server side (aka backend) as
              well. When used on the client side, JavaScript code is read,
              interpreted, and executed in the user’s web browser. When used on
              the server side, it is run on a remote computer. You can learn
              more about the difference between frontend and backend programming
              in our guide. JavaScript isn’t only used to create websites. It
              can also be used to build browser-based games and, with the help
              of certain frameworks, mobile apps for different operating
              systems. The creation of new libraries and frameworks is also
              making it possible to build backend programs with the language,
              such as web apps and server apps. If you’re interested in learning
              more, we’ve covered more examples of what is JavaScript used for,
              including code in more depth elsewhere. But now that we know some
              of the array of uses of this twenty five year-old language, why
              learn JavaScript right now?
